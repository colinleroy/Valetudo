# Supported Conga Devices
[Shenzhen 3irobotix Co.,Ltd.](http://www.3irobotics.com/en/) produces white-label vacuum robots.
They are sold under various brands. For example `Cecotec Conga` or `Viomi`.
Since they are basically the same products, hopefully, Valetudo will eventually support all of them.

For now however, there's only experimental support for the Viomi-branded ones which run a customized firmware
including a miio interface. The Cecotec branded ones do not need a custom firmware.

If you want to find out more about robot vacuum research,
check out [Dennis' Vacuum Robot Overview](https://dontvacuum.me/robotinfo/).

This is an incomplete list of supported Conga devices. Feel free to open a PR to extend this.<br/>
If you want to see everything that is supported by the codebase, check out the autogenerated [supported robots](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) page.

At least some of the Conga models have an internal timezone set to CST-8, which poses problems with timers as Valetudo expects the host to be on UTC.
You can fix it by editing /etc/config/system and rebooting the vaccuum.
